; The image map file instructs the SpeedFan Status Image on what image
; file should be displayed for what circumstance. The images listed 
; need to be in the same folder.
;
; The format is as follows:
; <Code>	<Image File>
; Note that each item is seperated by a tab.
;
; You can miss out any of the codes below and the Status Image will
; try to adapt sensibly. Usually this results in removing a threshold,
; apart from in the case ok leaving out the OK code, in which case no 
; icon will be displayed whilst within the desired range.
